## Material to use during the 2024's DIS Exam

Hi! :D  
I am sharing the resources I will use during the 2024 DIS Exam.

Please check this README for updates: If I end up adding/changing stuff, I will write a small summary of the update at the top of the file.  

At the time of this writing, in this repo you can find many folders separated by type (exams, quizzes of slides, the slides themselves, ...), in which you will find both isolated files and a file that is a merge of all the isolated files (for ease of CTRL+F).

Also, in the main directory, you can find two files: 
- `slidesAndQuizzesWithOCRMerged.pdf`, which has a merge of all the .pdfs available in the folders, and 
- `solvedExercisesMerged.ipynb`, which has a merge of all the notebooks available in the folders.  
<br>

All the .pdf pages that you find have been OCR'd, so all the text (of which, some was in images, like the slides) is searchable.

The `projects/` folder contains the project of my group, so you might consider replacing it for yours (or use ours because we are fantastic and got good grades :D).

If you have any questions, suggestions or comments, please let me know (eg. by adding an issue)!
